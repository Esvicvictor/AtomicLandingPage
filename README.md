# AtomicLandingPage
A website built for the fun of reactjs

Props were used to pass data from the parent to the child component.
The props data were stored in assets under the file known as data.js
A reusable component known as Card.jsx was created to give the card structure.
Then it was displayed on the About page using the map array method.
